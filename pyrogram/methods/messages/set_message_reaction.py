        Service messages can't be reacted to.
        Automatically forwarded messages from
        a channel to its discussion group have the
        same available reactions as messages in the channel.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            message_id (``int``):
                Identifier of the target message. If the message belongs to a media group, the reaction is set to the first non-deleted message in the group instead.

            reaction (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReactionType` *optional*):
                New list of reaction types to set on the message.
                Pass None as emoji (default) to retract the reaction.

            is_big (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to set the reaction with a big animation.
                Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            :obj: `~pyrogram.types.MessageReactions`: On success, True is returned.
